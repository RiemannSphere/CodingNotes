**Spring Big Picture with Dustin Schultz - Pluralsight**
- Spring is a family of projects
    - Spring Framework -> replacement for J2EE
    - Spring projects (Session, Security, Web Services, LDAP, ...)
    - Spring Boot (easy to start with Spring!)
        - auto-configuration (best guesse defaults)
        - standalone (we don't need deployment, any other environment)
    - Spring Cloud
